<h1><strong>History to live</strong></h1>
    <p>
        Between all <em>nowadays</em> awkward obstacles we still have <strong>a strange</strong>faith in some certain figures due to their astonishing<br />
         spirit, so who are those people? and how did we meet <em>the fact </em>that world could never recrearte such <strong>significant characters</strong>
        </p>
    <h3><strong>Perfect 10 Lady!👸🏻</strong></h3>
    <p> 
        <em>Her suname</em> was a great one.Maybe it was even a <strong>reserved trademark.</strong> How such a <strong>gorgeous</strong> jewel was added to such<br /> 
        a <strong>magnificent</strong> pearl! <em>Great wide audiences</em> come from all over the world to here,<strong>Egypt</strong>, only in
         order  to listen to her<br />
         name and her ancestors'names <strong>proudly</strong> called in <strong>a fabulous celebration</strong>:<em>Ra,Atun,Mina</em> and  now we call
         <strong>our princess,the<br />
         great mother, the brillint doctor and the empress of fairness and justice.</strong>  Please, Mrs.Nefrtiti Can you come to the stage?! <br />
        <strong>No one </strong> can deny her glorious achievements.But, what about <strong>her humanity, her astonishing spirit and her spectacular ambition</strong><br />
          The more we read about other characters like <strong>Alexander the Great and Bloody Mary</strong> the better we know our lady
</p>
    <h3>A man who forget his identity😥 </h3>
    <p>I was disappointed when I knew that over<strong>60%</strong>  of the egyptians know nothing about thier <strong>first lady</strong> this ultimate super<br />
     star whom every one recognise easily in all galaxies even those folks called  vikings once worshipped <strong>her majesty</strong>.<br />
    so on which day will all of us start reading <em>the book of her life</em> ? This corps won't evoke only our feelings towards<br />
     her.But,also towards the whole world.
